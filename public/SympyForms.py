"""Formula Class:

A class that takes in a JSON string of variables, and their unit conversions and other information as 1st argument, and their corresponding 
formula as a string as the second argument.
The variables are passed in through sys.argv[1], and formula through sys.argv[2]

On initialization the following properties are created:

-variable_array: an array created from the JSON string sys.argv[1]
    -"sympy_symbol" is appended to the array and and is sympy.Symbol object, same name as variable name
-formula_string: the formula string 
-sympy_equation: formula string converted to type sympy.Eq (the equation class)
-variable_to_solve_for: property created in substitute_converted_values()
-converted_answer: the variable solved for and converted 

Available methods:

-generate_value_tuples(): generator function that returns a named tuple with the following: variable_name, value, sympy_symbol, unit_conversion.
    easier to use these named tuples in many loops where the name of the value is useful for readability.

-substitute_converted_values(): this function takes in the sympy_equation and substitutes in the converted values,
    generates the variable_to_solve_for property

-solve_for_variable(): solves for the missing variable, must first have substitute_converted_values(): performed.
